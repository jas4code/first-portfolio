# My First Website

This is my very first website built from **_scratch_**.

This website is primarily created using  **ReactJS** and **TailwindCSS**.

### Web Languages Used:
- **HTML**, though I used **ReactJS** for this site.
- **CSS** (particularly **TailwindCSS** framework.)
- **JavaScript**.

I've created a lot of follow-thru websites from YouTube Tutorials.
Though I tweak most of the websites I created from following through the Turorials.
This is the website that I can say "_I created using the knowledge I gained from my **Front-End Development** learning journey._" 

_**Disclaimer:** Some of the design ideass are gathered from my favorites websites/blogsites, in order to create this website idea._ 

> _**PS:** Everthing inside this repository is open constructive criticism, and ssuggestions.
I am willing to learn from you guys!_
